	  		<h2>Over-Valued or Under-Valued?</h2>
			<p>The chart above shows the P/E ratios for the aggregate Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), as well as the 9 sectors that comprise the total. In addition, the chart also shows the historical average P/E ratio for the Dow since the year 2000 (data from <a href="https://macrotrends.net">Macro Trends<a/>). If the total or an individual sector bar chart is above the historical average, than it is over-valued. If it is below, than it is under-valued. Under-valued companies are often considered good buys. Over-valued stocks can still be good buys, but come at a higher price tag.</p>

		<h3>The Dow Jones Industrial Average</h3>
		<p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the United State's second-oldest stock market, created in 1896 by then Wall Street Journal editor Charles Dow. Originally consisting of 12 companies, the index now contains 30 industrials. The index's value is computed by a price-weighted methodology. Because the Dow contains the 30 largest "blue-chip" American companies, it is often considered the preeminent index for measuring current financial conditions.</p>
