			<p>The federal government is primarily funded through individual income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate taxes. In 2018, federal revenue totaled 16.6 percent of GDP. </p>

			<p>Federal spending is composed of mandatory spending, which is written into law, and discretionary spending, which must be re-appropriated each year. Mandatory spending funds some of the largest government programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Defense spending is part of the discretionary budget. Non-defense discretionary spending includes all other functions of government you may be familiar with. Federal spending totaled 20.6 percent of GDP in 2018.</p>

			 <h2> Rising debt will constrain economic growth and policy responses to income inequality
			 <br>...Especially after accounting for the effects of the new tax law.</h2>

			 <p>Notice that federal spending exceeds federal revenues - the extent to which this occurs is called the deficit. In 2018, the federal deficit was 3.9 percent of GDP. The compounding of annual deficits and interest payments generates estimates of the federal debt.</p>

			 <h2> Federal debt as a share of GDP has increased steadily over time and is projected to continue its upward ascent.</h2>

			 <h2> It may not seem as high as some of the countries, however....</h2>

			 <p>Japan is considered to be stable because most of its debt (including government bond liabilities) are held by its own citizen and the risk of defaulting is quite low. The ‘runner-up’ Greece has experienced debt crises and subsequent bail-out by IMF in 2010. In fact, 'PIGS' (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, or 'PIIGS' including Ireland) countries suffered from the recent European debt crisis. 
			 <br>
			 While such debt crisis is unlikely for the US, rising debt is limiting US capacity to act on important policies such as income inequality.
