	  		<h4>Over-Valued or Under-Valued?</h3>
			<p><p> The chart above shows the P/E ratios for the aggregate Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), as well as the 9 sectors that comprise the total. In addition, the chart also shows the historical average P/E ratio for the Dow since the year 2000 (data from <a href="https://macrotrends.net">Macro Trends<a/>). If the total or an individual sector bar chart is above the historical average, than it is over-valued. If it is below, than it is under-valued. Under-valued companies are often considered good buys. Over-valued stocks can still be good buys, but come at a higher price tag.  </p></p>

			<h4>The Stock Market Valuation</h3>
			<p><p> The U.S. stock market is oft-thought to be one of the strongest bell-weathers of local, national and international economic growth. The graph above shows the current valuation of the Dow Jone Industrial Average (DJIA), the U.S. economy's headline stock market, in terms of its Price-Earnings (P/E) ratio. </p></p>

			<h4>The Dow Jones Industrial Average</h3>
			<p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the United State's second-oldest stock market, created in 1896 by then Wall Street Journal editor Charles Dow. Originally consisting of 12 companies, the index now contains 30 industrials. The index's value is computed by a price-weighted methodology. Because the Dow contains the 30 largest "blue-chip" American companies, it is often considered the preeminent index for measuring current financial conditions.</p></p>

	  	<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-disk" aria-hidden="true"></span>
	  		<h4>How Was This Chart Created?</h3>
			<p><p> This chart was created by Jake Schneider utilizing a web scraper to obtain data on all 30 Dow companies. Within excel, weighted averages were calculated to model sectoral P/E ratios. The data was then visualized and posted onto this site. Check back often as the data changes regularly. </p></p>

	  		<h4>How To Use This Chart?</h3>
			<p><p> The lay investor often wonders how best to pick their stocks. This chart provides actionable advice by demonstrating which sectors (and the market writ-large) are over- or under-valued. This chart, in combination with other methods for evaluating company future prospects, can help any investor make better allocations. </p></p>
