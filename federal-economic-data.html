<h1>Federal Economic Data</h1>
<h2> United States Economic Indicators
<br> By: Hilary Gelfond </h2>

<p> Home to 326 million people and the largest economy in the world (with a GDP of over $20 trillion in 2018), the economic outlook for the United States has a significant impact on that of the rest of the world.
	<br>
	<br>
Read below to learn about the size of the US government, the rising rate of federal debt, aggregate  indicators of individual economic wellbeing and a summary of income inequality.
</p>

<h2> Individual Economic Wellbeing</h2>


<h2> Federal Fiscal Outlook</h2>

<p> This is a static version of a graph I will make detailing federal debt. Users will be able to scroll along the line and text boxes containing details about the debt at significant times (ie. wars, recessions) will appear. There will also be a toggle button that shifts the "projected" portion of the graph based on different policy assumptions (I already have the data for this).
